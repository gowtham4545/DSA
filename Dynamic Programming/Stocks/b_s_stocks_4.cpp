// Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

/*
You have been given an array 'PRICES' consisting of 'N' integers where PRICES[i] denotes the price of a 
given stock on the i-th day. You are also given an integer 'K' denoting the number of possible transactions 
you can make.
Your task is to find the maximum profit in at most K transactions. A valid transaction involves buying 
a stock and then selling it.
Note:
You canâ€™t engage in multiple transactions simultaneously, i.e. you must sell the stock before rebuying it.
